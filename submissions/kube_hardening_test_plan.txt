1. How will you test the changes?
Changes will be tested in a non-production environment such as a test cluster, this test cluster would mimic production cluster to maximize the accuracy of tests, this should be achievable via declarative configurations (Vagrant, Kubernetes cluster.yaml, applications Helm Charts etc).  A portion of the production traffic will be redirected to the test cluster via load-balancer or service-mesh configurations.  The test cluster will be monitored while it serves the portion of production traffic via the observability stack (Prometheus/Metrics, Grafana, Logs and Traces).  Also, the rollback procedures/scripts will be tested and validated against the test cluster for correctness.

2. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
 The change will be tested in a non-production cluster as described above. Once the change is applied in Production, I will monitor metrics via the observability stack (Prometheus/Metrics, Grafana, Logs and Traces).  The cluster.yaml will be version-controlled so that the change can be rolled back easily. However, as a reboot is required, it's not trivial to do quickly. Therefore, testing against the test cluster will be performed thoroughly and accurately.
