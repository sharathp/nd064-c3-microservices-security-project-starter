1. Incident commander name:
Sharath

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods running three different crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) were launched on our kubernetes cluster.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker was able to get control of our kubernetes cluster and run crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) containers on the cluster. Attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.

4. Summary of the impact:
The attacker managed to run crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) on our kubernetes cluster, which is undesirable. Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of CPU. The Kubernetes/compute resources dashboard in Grafana shows the significant spike in CPU utilization, this is related to the crypto miners being started.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
* Our administrator ran the following command to evict the crypto miner pods:
"kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>".  This evicted the miner pods and CPU utilization fell to the pre-incident levels as the crypto mining pods are evicted.
* The "Falco Dashboard Udacity" also reflected flat line for crypto-mining-related alerts, as the crypto mining pods are evicted.
* All access credentials to the kubernetes credentials are being rotated/refreshed, this is a precautionary measure given the attacker was able to run the pods and therefore would have had access to an administrative terminal, kube config file or UI.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
* Admission controllers should have been used to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods.
* Our monitoring and alerting capabilities (Falco, Prometheus & Grafana) proved to be working as expected as it helped identify these malicious events.
